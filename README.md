[![Subscribe to Release Notes](https://release-notes.com/badges/v1.svg)](https://release-notes.com/@xMartin/Grouptabs)

[Grouptabs](https://grouptabs.net/) lets you track shared expenses in a group of friends in a fun way.

It is an offline-capable installable web app, currently with a mobile (small screens) focus.

It uses PouchDB for persistence and to sync data to a central CouchDB data storage. Collaboration works without user accounts. Just share the tab ID.

The UI is built using ReactJS and Redux.

The app is based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with TypeScript.
